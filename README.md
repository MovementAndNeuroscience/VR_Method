The study aimed to develop a reliable PC control condition for a VR experiment assessing selective attention in grade 0 children.  
The selective attention task we developed and implemented can be accessed here:  
- PC : https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7844487  
- VR : https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7844593  

### Participants  
73 grade 0 children from Danish primary schools completed the selective attention test in both VR and PC environments. Performance quality was low and thus we only included 19 participants in final analyses. All data, included and excluded, are openly available in this repository.  

### Data  
- Raw data from the PC condition can be found in the RAW PC folder   
- Raw data from the VR condition can be found in the RAW VR folder   
- Demographic data, anonymised, can be found in the demographics.csv file  
- The final data from the 19 participants included in statistical analyses can be found in the final_data_set.csv file  

### Analysis  
- Demographic analyses can be found in the demographics.R file  
- Data processing, quality control and statistical analyses can be found in the full_analysis_script.Rmd 
- The plots folder holds plots used in the study report
